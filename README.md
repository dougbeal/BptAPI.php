# Brown Paper Tickets PHP API
[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/brownpapertickets/BptAPI.php.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/brownpapertickets/BptAPI.php) [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/brown-paper-tickets/bpt-api.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/brown-paper-tickets/bpt-api) [![License MIT](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE)

The BptAPI library consists of a set of classes that enable you to easily interact with the [Brown Paper Tickets API](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/apidocs/index.html).

Since this library is still in early development, method names will possibly change.
See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on any breaking changes.

## Install
Via Composer:
`$ composer require brown-paper-tickets/bpt-api`.

(This will also install Monolog\Monolog as a dev dependency, if you don't need Monolog, add the `--no-dev` flag to composer.)

## Usage  
See [Usage.md](Usage.md) for a brief intro. You can also checkout the [api-example](https://www.github.com/brownpapertickets/api-example) app for a more complete example.

## Options

Currently there are three options that you can set: `debug`, `logErrors` and `logger`.

You can set them either by passing in an `$options` array as the second argument when you instantiate the classes or by using the `setOption()` method.`

| option | type | description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| logger | PSR-3 Logger Interface | If you want to make use of a logger (like Monolog), you can pass it in with this option.
| debug | boolean | If debug is set to true, all errors will be logged as well as all the raw API call url's and responses.
| logErrors | boolean | If set to true, all API errors will be logged to the object's `errors` array. If you have set a logger, they will also be logged there as well.|

For example:
```php
$logger = new \Monolog\Logger('logger');

$logger->pushHandler(new \Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler(__DIR__ . '/app.log', $logger::DEBUG));

$options = array(
    'logger' => $logger,
    'debug' => true,
    'logErrors' => true,
);
$info = new EventInfo(DEV_ID, $options);
```

`$info->setOption('logger', $logger);`

### ManageCart

Some methods will return a results array with two fields. The first is `success` which is a bolean indicating whether or not it failed and a `message` field explaining why.

#### initCart($cartID = null, $createdAt = null)
Starts a new cart session with Brown Paper Tickets. You can also pass in an existing `cartID` and the time it was `createdAt`. If the cart has expired it will return a results array with `success` set to `false`.

If successful, it will return a results array with `success` set to `true` as well as a `cartID` and `cartCreatedAt` field.

__Returns__
The newly created `cartID`. This cart will expire after 15 minutes.


#### isExpired()
Determines whether or not the `cartID` has expired.

#### getCartId()

__Returns__
The `cartID`.


#### setAffiliateID($affiliateID)

Pass your affiliate ID if you want to earn a commission on the sale.

#### setPrices($prices)
Set the prices to send to the cart. Will return the set prices.
This does not update the actual cart (use `sendPrices()` for that).

This will throw out any prices with an invalid shipping method and will determine
whether or not will call names need to be required when adding shipping info.

Pass in an array of prices IDs. Each Price ID value should be set to an array
with the following fields:

| parameter | type | description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `shippingMethod` | integer | An integer representing shipping method*
| `quantity` | integer | the number of tickets you wish to add. |
| `affiliateID` | integer | Optional. If you wish to earn a commision, add the affiliate ID. |

* Shipping Methods 1 for Physical, 2 for Will Call, 3 for Print at Home.

```php
$prices = array(
    '12345' => array(
        'shippingMethod' => 1,
        'quantity' => 2,
    ),
    '12346' => array(
        'shippingMethod' => 3,
        'quantity' => 3
    )
);
```

Returns an array of the set prices.

#### removePrices($prices)
Pass in an array of price IDs and it will remove the price IDs passed from the set prices. This does not update the actual cart (use `sendPrices()` for that).

__Returns__
An array of the set prices.

#### sendPrices()
Send the prices to the cart via the API.

Returns the results array.

#### getPrices()
Returns the prices set.

#### getValue()
Returns the current value of the cart as it was set when adding prices.
Note: When the class sets the value, it will determine whether or not certain fields are required for the billing info. See `setShipping()` for more info.

#### setShipping($shipping)
Pass in an array of shipping information.

| field | notes |
|------|-------|
| firstName | |
| lastName | |
| address | |
| address2 | |
| city | |
| state | |
| zip | |
| country | Values include "United States" and "Canada". |

If you have selected tickets that require Will Call names, you can pass in a different name using the `willCallFirstName` and `willCallLastName` fields. Otherwise it will default to using the first and last name fields for will call names.

#### setBilling($billing)
Pass in an array of billing information.

Always pass these fields:

| field | notes |
|-------|-------|
| firstName | |
| lastName | |

When the cart's value is greater than 0, you must also include the following fields. If you do not, then the cart will return the results array with the message ""

| field | notes |
|-------|-------|
| address | |
| address2 | |
| city | |
| state | |
| zip | |
| email | |
| phone | |
| country | Values include "United States" and "Canada". |

Returns a results array.

#### sendBilling(Array $ccInfo)
Sends the billing information to the cart.

When the cart's value is greater than 0, you must include the cc info array:

| field | notes |
|-------|-------|
| type | Credit card type. Must be "Visa", "Mastercard", "Discover" or "Amex" |
| number | Credit card number. Must be a string |
| expMonth | Expiration month. |
| expYear | Expriration year. |
| cvv2 | Credit card verification code |

Once this has been called and is successful, you will no longer be able to `sendPrices()`, `sendShipping()` or `sendBilling()`.


Returns a results array with the following fields:

| field | notes |
|-------|-------|
| success | boolean |
| message | A description of the results |
| ticketUrl | If successful and this shipping method was chosen, a link to the print-at-home tickets |
| cartID | the ID of the cart ID |
| receiptURL | If successful, a URL to the order's receipt on BPT. |

#### getReceipt()
Returns the results received by the `sendBilling()` method.

## Latest Changes

(See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for full set of changes)

## v0.15.3
* Fixed issue in `getImages` method.

## v0.15.2
* Added .gitattributes to prevent tests and other crap from being downloaded with packagist.

* __Breaking Changes__
    * The ManageCart class no longer saves the credit card info to the object. You must now pass in the credit card info array to `MangeCart::sendBilling` method rather than `ManageCart::setBilling` as was done before.

## v0.15.1
* Fixed `__construct` logger option

### v0.15.0

* Added ability to capture all requests sent to the API and the raw response. Add `'debug' => true` to the `options` arrays upon instantiation or use `setOption('debug', true)`.
* Added `setLogger()` method that accepts a PSR-3 compatible logger (i.e. [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog)). You can also pass it in in the `options` array when instantiating.
